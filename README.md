## Features

- **Plant Inventory Management** â€“ Create, view, update, and delete plant records with fields such as scientific name, common name, watering frequency, location (indoor/outdoor), and optional notes.
- **AI-Autofill** â€“ When a scientific name is entered, the Gemini API automatically fills in optional plant details such as preferred soil type, propagation methods, edible parts, and pet safety. All AI-generated data can be reviewed and edited by the user.
- **Weather Alerts** â€“  The backend checks daily forecasts and sends email alerts for conditions like frost, heat waves, cold snaps, or extended dry heat spells, helping users take preventive action for outdoor plants.
- **Watering Reminders** â€“ Based on a plantâ€™s custom watering schedule, users receive email reminders. Multiple plants due on the same day are combined into a single digest email.
- **Zip-to-Coordinates Conversion** â€“ At signup or when updating a ZIP code, the app uses the LocationIQ API to convert the ZIP code into latitude and longitude coordinates, which are stored and used for weather forecasting.
